		A girl is kneeling down on top of a mountain,<br>
		Look upon her eye: Teary,<br>
		and dark as the night that <br>
		surrounds her,<br>
		But a glimmer of hope,<br>
		of determination in it.<br>
		<br>
		A phoenix appears,<br>
		Burning red like fire inside,<br>
		But seeming by the rainy storm<br>
		To be but warm as the hearth:<br>
		<br>
		Its wings envelop the broken girl.<br>
		<br>
		Slip back down below, into the forest.<br>
		Green, the sun shines.<br>
		It is springtime, and the flowers are in bloom:<br>
		White lilies...<br>
		<br>
		They seem so innocent, so pure,<br>
		But all the same remind the boy <br>
		who trundles through them<br>
		with his little sister,<br>
		of death.<br>
		<br>
		Too young to understand, <br>
		she gazes up at him<br>
		with her rows of gnashing teeth,<br>
		her eyes charred black<br>
		like the hell that she knows so well.<br>
		<br>
		With a sad smile, the two walk on.<br>
		<br>
		On a long winding road,<br>
		a lone figure walks.<br>
		Her face covered by a cloak,<br>
		she barely glances up<br>
		when others pass her by. <br>
		<br>
		As darkness falls,<br>
		she slows her pace;<br>
		above her circles a crow:<br>
		"You lied, you lied!"...<br>
		With shame she quickly turns away,<br>
		the world knows her treachery.<br>
		<br>
		But the sounds of the spirits <br>
		whisper softly to her as always:<br>
		because of them she is never truly alone.<br>
		<br>
		As she walks up onto the top of the mountain,<br>
		she kneels and bows her head,<br>
		the warmth of the hearth<br>
		surrounds her...<br>
		and for once she is able to smile.<br>
		<br>
		When she opens her eyes,<br>
		they reflect an image of the sun<br>
		slipping over the horizon,<br>
		and she quits the company of man<br>
		for the last time.
